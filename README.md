# Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number' in TypeScript

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where a function expecting numerical arguments is called with a string argument.  The TypeScript compiler correctly flags this as an error, preventing runtime issues.

The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.ts` shows how to fix it using type guards or input validation.
